# 32bit-ARM-like-CPU-design
A 32-bit ARM-like CPU implemented in Verilog with a simplified single-cycle architecture. Includes datapath, ALU, register file, instruction decode, control logic, and flag handling. The repository provides synthesizable RTL, testbenches, waveforms, and documentation of the instruction set and microarchitecture.
